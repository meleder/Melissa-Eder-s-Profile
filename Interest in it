Interest in IT

My interest in IT started bacy in the 1980's.   My brothers had a texas instrauments computer which I loved to get on and connect to the internet.
IT was good for me as I had enourmous difficulities in high school, failing every subject, unable to connect with others.
IT made sense to me.  Due to me failing school, I left early 1985, and my parents said I had to do something.  So I started searching for basic computer courses.  I started in mid years at RMIT TAFe doing the Basic Electronics Course and the Computer Field Service Course.
